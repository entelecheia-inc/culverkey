# culverkey

Culvkey is a chat app which has no sign up and login.  Both parties end up in the same channel if they have the same 
cryptographic key.  For now, only 1-on-1 chats are supported. 

The common cryptographic key is used for authentication, while the actual encryption uses the Signal protocol.
